# Governance and Ethics

## Governance

The ML lifecycle
1. Design 
    - Planning
        - requirements
        - project management
    - Data engineering
        - datasets - copyright, etc.
        - architecture
2. Model dev
    - Model 
        - model - which model will we use?
        - results
    - Model evaluation
        - results
3. Operations
    - Deployment
        - software 
        - architecture
    - Monitoring
        - logs

At each stage we produce countless by products.

### How can we keep track of artifacts?

Namely datasets, model, model training & eval

- Data cards
    - usual attributes
    - use cases
    - motivations
    - applications etc.
- Model cards
    - model details
    - intended use
    - metrics
    - training/eval data
    - ethical considerations
    - external factors

## Ethics

- Planning
    - Need expert advice 
- Who is to blame if a model fails?
    - engineer? curator of data?
- Data might bias areas with more data coverage, less accuracy for underrepresented areas

## AI Legislation

- No legislation for AI in the UK.
- AI is regulated through:
    - UK DPA 
    - Equality and human rights
    - IP
- US legislation blueprint
    - not currently a law
    - safety features
    - bias
    - data privacy 
    - human alternatives must be considered
    - use cases of AI
- EU AI act, the first regulation on AI
    - general purpose
        - dataset summary
    - high risk
        - aviation, healthcare, etc.
    - unacceptable risk
        - manipulation of groups of people
        - biometric identification systems
        - social scoring
