# ML Ops

## Motivation

Model creation and model evaluation

Example tasks:
- Full requirements analysis
- Data engineering
- Infrastructual setup
- Software development
- Testing and verification
- etc

## ML Lifecycle

We can think about 3 components of the machine learning workflow:
1. Design
    - planning
    - data engineering
2. Model development
    - model training
    - model evaluation
3. Operations
    - deployment
    - monitoring

## Issues

- Lack of user consideration
    - do they know what they are being shown?
- When do you stop fine-tuning?
- How do you provide assurance about a model's performance
- Is evaluation 1-step of iterative?
- What is data stream changes?

Data drift is a shift in the expected distributions of the data. 

Concept (model) drift happens when mapping from input to output changes over time.  

## Modern Technologies

Most data science operates on the cloud. These applications allow you to integrate model pipelines with data pipelines.
