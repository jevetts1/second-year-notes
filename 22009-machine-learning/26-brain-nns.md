# Brain NNs

## Motivation

AI/ML models are usually inpsired by scientific concepts in nature and from humans.
- flocking
- ants
- pollination
- bees

## Mimicking human cognition

- learning
- reasoning
- perception
- decision making

# ANNs vs SNNs

Artificial vs Spiking

|| ANNs    | SNNs |
|-| -------- | ------- |
|Signal| Continuous signals.  | Discrete signals at specific times. |
|Time dependence | No explicit time. | Depends on time of spiking.|
|Biological similarity| Simplified model | Closely simulates - mimics action potential. |
