# Animation

## Keyframe

- Animators draw characters at extreme poses
- Interpolate between the "key" poses
- Labour intensive

## Mocap

- Performers movements are translated into the computer model

## Rigging

- Very expensive operation - difficult manual labour

### Procedural

- You could apply a function to the points specifying the shape: $p' = f(p)$
    - Linear deformations
- You can also do non-linear deformations, like bulges, twists etc.

### Skeleton

- Build a skeleton of the character and put skin on top of it
